**Project Description**
---------------------------

In this project, I have used unsupervised machine learning to categorize clients based on features of their purchase behavior. Predictive marketing may help businesses by finding clients that have similar demands or respond similarly to particular marketing activity. From insight of my analysis, it can undoubtedly help business in determining the suitable categories to direct their targeted marketing campaigns.To conduct the success in determining the clusters I have used 5 step methodology.

**Business Understanding** -> **Data Understanding** -> **Data Preparation** -> **Modeling** -> **Conclusion**

Hunter's e-grocery is a well-known new generation lifestyle brand. That has a brand presence in ten countries and is continually seeking for new methods to better and anticipate the demands of their customers. Black swan events such as Covid-19, the Ukraine crisis, and the gas scarcity have all had an influence on the purchasing behaviour of clients. Therefore, using an unsupervised machine learning model and Principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, I have developed a business values proposition for predictive marketing in order to target the customers based on features of their purchasing behavior.
